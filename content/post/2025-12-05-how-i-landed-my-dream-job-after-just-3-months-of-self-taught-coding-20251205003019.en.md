---

In today's digital age, the demand for skilled coders is skyrocketing. For many, the idea of switching careers or starting fresh in the tech industry can seem daunting. However, as I learned firsthand, it is entirely possible to transition into a coding career in a short time frame. In this blog post, I'll share my story of how I secured a job in tech after only three months of self-taught coding.

## The Decision to Learn Coding

### Why I Chose Coding

After spending several years in a non-technical field, I found myself yearning for a career that offered more creativity and problem-solving opportunities. The world of coding seemed appealing, and the prospect of building websites and applications excited me. I decided to take the plunge and teach myself coding.

### Setting Goals

To keep myself motivated, I set clear, achievable goals. My primary objective was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within three months. I also aimed to build a portfolio of projects that would showcase my skills to potential employers.

## The Learning Journey

### Finding the Right Resources

With countless online resources available, it was essential to identify the best ones. I opted for a mix of online courses, tutorials, and coding challenges. Websites like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and Udemy became my go-to platforms for structured learning.

### Developing a Routine

Consistency was key to my success. I dedicated at least three hours each day to coding. Breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable tasks helped me grasp concepts more easily. I also made it a point to engage with online coding communities, where I could ask questions and share my progress.

### Building Projects

As I learned, I applied my skills by creating small projects. My first project was a personal website, followed by a simple to-do list application. These projects not only solidified my knowledge but also became essential components of my coding portfolio.

## Networking and Job Applications

### Building a Portfolio

After three months of hard work, I compiled my projects into a well-organized portfolio. This portfolio showcased my coding skills and demonstrated my ability to solve real-world problems. A strong portfolio is crucial for any self-taught coder, as it serves as tangible proof of your abilities.

### Utilizing LinkedIn and Other Platforms

I created a LinkedIn profile highlighting my coding journey. I joined relevant groups and participated in discussions, which helped me connect with industry professionals. Networking played a significant role in my job search, as many opportunities arise through personal connections.

### Applying for Jobs

With my portfolio and LinkedIn profile in place, I began applying for entry-level positions. I tailored my resume to highlight my self-taught coding journey and emphasized my projects. I focused on companies that valued skills over formal education.

## The Interview Process

### Preparing for Interviews

After submitting numerous applications, I landed several interviews. I prepared by practicing common coding questions and algorithms. Participating in mock interviews with friends helped me gain confidence and improve my communication skills.

### Showcasing My Skills

During interviews, I was able to discuss my projects in detail. I explained the challenges I faced and how I overcame them, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities. This approach resonated with interviewers, as they appreciated my hands-on experience and determination.

## The Job Offer

After weeks of interviews, I received an offer for an entry-level web developer position at a startup. The role aligned perfectly with my interests, and I was thrilled to accept. This opportunity was a testament to the power of self-directed learning and perseverance.

## Conclusion

My journey from a non-technical background to securing a job in tech in just three months of self-taught coding is proof that determination and hard work can lead to successful outcomes. For anyone considering a similar path, remember that consistency, networking, and a strong portfolio are essential. The tech industry is constantly evolving, and with the right mindset, you too can achieve your career goals. So, roll up your sleeves, start coding, and embrace the journey ahead!
