Before purchasing a product, be sure to check the reviews and ratings of other consumers. This allows you to grasp the actual quality and performance of the product. In particular, it is good to read detailed reviews in addition to star ratings.

### H3: Choose Safe Payment Methods

Payment is a very important part of online shopping. Use a reliable payment method to protect your personal information. If possible, it is safe to use a service that generates virtual card numbers or use a trusted payment platform.

Even after purchasing a product, it is good to check a few items on a checklist.

After the product is shipped, check the status through shipping tracking. You can respond quickly in case of delivery delays or problems.

Check the return policy of each shopping mall in advance in case you do not like the product after receiving it. Knowing the return conditions and procedures makes it easier to handle if a problem arises.

### H3: Write a Review

Try writing a review for the purchased product. This not only helps other consumers greatly but can also be an opportunity to receive additional benefits from the shopping mall.
